# open-quantum-safe/openssl

OpenSSL is an open-source TLS/SSL and crypto library [https://openssl.org/](https://openssl.org/).  ([View the original README file for OpenSSL](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OpenSSL_1_0_2-stable/README).)

This repository contains a fork of OpenSSL that adds quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms and ciphersuites.

## Overview

The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.  

**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms.  liboqs initially focuses on key exchange algorithms.  See more about liboqs at [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/), including a list of supported algorithms.

**open-quantum-safe/openssl** is an integration of liboqs into OpenSSL 1.0.2.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography.  The integration should not be considered "production quality".

More information on OQS can be found in slides 64â€“67 of [this presentation](https://www.douglas.stebila.ca/files/research/presentations/20160812-SAC.pdf) by Douglas Stebila.

## Contents

open-quantum-safe/openssl currently contains:

- Integration of post-quantum key exchange primitives from liboqs into OpenSSL's `speed` command
- Ciphersuites using post-quantum key exchange based on primitives from liboqs, including hybrid ciphersuites which also use ECDHE key exchange

### Key exchange mechanisms

liboqs currently supports the following key exchange mechanisms:

- `RLWE_BCNS15`: key exchange from the ring learning with errors problem (Bos, Costello, Naehrig, Stebila, *IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy 2015*, [https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/599](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/599))

### Ciphersuites

For each post-quantum key exchange primitive `X`, there are the following ciphersuites:

- `X-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`
- `X-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`
- `X-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`
- `X-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`
- `X-ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`
- `X-ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`
- `X-ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`
- `X-ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`

There is also a "generic" ciphersuite (`X` = `GENERIC`) which uses whichever key exchange primitive is configured as the default key exchange primitive in liboqs.  It is set to `GENERIC` = `RLWE_BCNS15`, but this can be changed.


## Building

Builds have been tested on Mac OS X 10.11.6 and Ubuntu 16.04.1.

To build, clone or download the source from Github:

	git clone --branch OpenSSL_1_0_2-stable --recursive https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl.git
	cd openssl

To configure OpenSSL, on Linux type:

	./config
	
and on Mac OS X type:

	./Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc
	
Then type:

	make depend
	make
	
This will build both liboqs and OpenSSL.  

## Running

See the [liboqs Github site](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/) for information on test programs in liboqs.

### openssl speed

OpenSSL's `speed` command performs basic benchmarking of cryptographic primitives.  You can see results for primitives from liboqs by typing

	apps/openssl speed oqskex

### TLS demo

OpenSSL contains a basic TLS server (`s_server`) and TLS client (`s_client`) which can be used to demonstrate and test SSL/TLS connections.

To see the list of supported ciphersuites from OQS, type:

	apps/openssl ciphers OQSKEX-GENERIC:OQSKEX-GENERIC-ECDHE:OQSKEX-RLWE-BCNS15:OQSKEX-RLWE-BCNS15-ECDHE

To run a server, we first need to generate a self-signed X.509 certificate.  Run the following command:

	apps/openssl req -x509 -new -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -nodes -out server.cer -sha256 -days 365 -config apps/openssl.cnf

Hit enter in response to all the prompts to accept the defaults.  

When done, type to combine the key and certificate (as required by `s_server`):

	cat server.key server.cer > server.pem

To run a basic TLS server with all OQS ciphersuites enabled:

	apps/openssl s_server -cipher OQSKEX-GENERIC:OQSKEX-GENERIC-ECDHE:OQSKEX-RLWE-BCNS15:OQSKEX-RLWE-BCNS15-ECDHE

In another terminal window, you can run a TLS client for any or all of the supported ciphersuites, for example:

	apps/openssl s_client -cipher OQSKEX-GENERIC
	apps/openssl s_client -cipher OQSKEX-GENERIC-ECDHE
	apps/openssl s_client -cipher OQSKEX-RLWE-BCNS15
	apps/openssl s_client -cipher OQSKEX-RLWE-BCNS15-ECDHE

## Team
